They decided to part ways with head coach John Fox, who had achieved an impressive feat of winning four divisional championships during his four-year tenure with the Broncos. To fill the vacancy, they hired Gary Kubiak as the new head coach. Kubiak's plan was to implement a run-oriented offense with zone blocking, complementing quarterback Peyton Manning's exceptional shotgun passing skills. However, the team encountered difficulties due to multiple changes in the offensive line and a challenging season for Manning. Manning, who had a phenomenal career with the Indianapolis Colts since 1998, suffered from plantar fasciitis in his left foot, a condition that had been plaguing him since the summer. Moreover, being 39 years old at the time, Manning was also facing the natural effects of aging. Despite starting the season with a 7-0 record, Manning struggled with interceptions and in week 10, he endured a partial tear in the plantar fasciitis of his left foot. During this game, Manning managed to break the NFL's all-time record for career passing yards, but after throwing four interceptions, he was replaced by backup quarterback Brock Osweiler. Osweiler took over as the starter for most of the regular season, but unfortunately, he got injured too. This led to Manning's return in the Week 17 regular season finale, a game against the 4-11 San Diego Chargers where the Broncos were trailing 13-7. Manning's remarkable performance led the team to a crucial 27-20 victory, securing them the number one overall AFC seed for the playoffs. The Broncos' defense, overseen by the skilled defensive coordinator Wade Phillips, dominated the league by ranking first in total yards allowed, passing yards allowed, and sacks. Despite the offensive challenges, the team finished the regular season with an impressive 12-4 record, earning them home-field advantage throughout the AFC playoffs.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 344, "text": "Gary Kubiak"}, {"answer_start": 344, "text": "Gary Kubiak"}, {"answer_start": 349, "text": "Kubiak"}], "question": "Who is the head coach of the Broncos?", "id": "56beb4e43aeaaa14008c9265"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1280, "text": "Brock Osweiler"}, {"answer_start": 1280, "text": "Brock Osweiler"}, {"answer_start": 1286, "text": "Osweiler"}], "question": "Who played quarterback for the Broncos after Peyton Manning was benched?", "id": "56beb4e43aeaaa14008c9266"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 705, "text": "Indianapolis Colts"}, {"answer_start": 701, "text": "the Indianapolis Colts"}, {"answer_start": 718, "text": "Colts"}], "question": "Who did Peyton Manning play for as a rookie?", "id": "56beb4e43aeaaa14008c9267"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1492, "text": "San Diego Chargers"}, {"answer_start": 1492, "text": "San Diego Chargers"}, {"answer_start": 1502, "text": "Chargers"}], "question": "Who did the Broncos play in the last week of the regular season?", "id": "56beb4e43aeaaa14008c9268"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1755, "text": "Wade Phillips"}, {"answer_start": 1755, "text": "Wade Phillips"}, {"answer_start": 1760, "text": "Phillips"}], "question": "Who is Denver's defensive coordinator?", "id": "56beb4e43aeaaa14008c9269"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 236, "text": "four"}, {"answer_start": 236, "text": "four"}, {"answer_start": 236, "text": "four"}], "question": "How many years was John Fox the head coach of the Denver Broncos?", "id": "56bf301c3aeaaa14008c954d"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 344, "text": "Gary Kubiak"}, {"answer_start": 344, "text": "Gary Kubiak"}, {"answer_start": 349, "text": "Kubiak"}], "question": "What is the name of the Bronco's head coach, who was hired after John Fox?

It is worth noting that while many players eagerly dove into the pile, giving their all to retrieve the loose ball, Newton did not display the same level of aggression, which later became a subject of heavy criticism. Denver's offense faced a tough challenge with three plays, but thankfully a holding penalty by cornerback Josh Norman granted the Broncos a fresh set of downs. This ultimately led to Anderson's remarkable 2-yard touchdown run, followed by Manning's successful pass to Bennie Fowler for a 2-point conversion, resulting in a substantial 24\u201310 lead for Denver with only 3 minutes and 8 seconds remaining.

The Denver Broncos emerged victorious, despite being significantly outperformed by the Carolina Panthers in terms of total yards gained (315 to 194) and first downs obtained (21 to 11). Remarkably, Denver's recorded 194 yards and 11 first downs marked the lowest totals ever recorded by a Super Bowl winning team, surpassing the previous record held by the Baltimore Ravens who gained 244 yards in Super Bowl XXXV. It is worth noting that only seven other teams had ever accumulated fewer than 200 yards in a Super Bowl, and in all those instances, they had ended up losing the game. The Broncos' remarkable feat of securing seven sacks tied the Super Bowl record previously set by the Chicago Bears in Super Bowl XX, while Kony Ealy's three sacks equaled a Super Bowl record. Furthermore, the Broncos' Jordan Norwood achieved a new record with a 61-yard punt return, surpassing the previous record of 45 yards set by John Taylor in Super Bowl XXIII. On the downside, both teams struggled significantly on third down conversions, with the Broncos converting only 1 out of 14 attempts, and the Panthers only slightly better at 3 out of 15 attempts. This resulted in a combined third-down conversion percentage of 13.8, marking a Super Bowl low. In terms of individual performance, both quarterbacks, Peyton Manning and Cam Newton, had relatively low passer ratings of 56.6 and 55.4, respectively, with their combined total of 112 setting a new record for the lowest aggregate passer rating in a Super Bowl. At the age of 39, Manning became the oldest quarterback to ever win a Super Bowl, and his victory with the Broncos made him the first quarterback to win a Super Bowl with two different teams.

The city's strategic location, situated between the capitals Krak\u00f3w and Vilnius, played a crucial role in this development. It is remarkable to think that Warsaw survived many wars, conflicts, and invasions throughout its long history.\n\nIn 1795, after the Third Partition of Poland, Warsaw fell under the Kingdom of Prussia's control. However, it was during the Napoleonic Wars in 1806 that the city became the official capital of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw, a puppet state established by Napoleon Bonaparte. The Congress of Vienna later decided that the Russian Empire would annex Warsaw in 1815, making it part of the \"Congress Kingdom.\" The city remained under foreign rule until 1918 when it finally regained its independence, emerging as the capital of the independent Republic of Poland.\n\nWarsaw's resilience earned it the title of the \"Phoenix City.\" This is due to the fact that it has survived countless wars, conflicts, and invasions throughout its storied past. Notably, the city endured the devastating consequences of World War II, where 85% of its buildings were destroyed. The German invasion in 1939 brought tragedy, including the massacre of the Jewish population and deportations to concentration camps. The heroic Warsaw Ghetto Uprising of 1943 and the major Warsaw Uprising of 1944 serve as enduring symbols of resistance.\n\nToday, as I walk through the reconstructed streets of Warsaw, I am reminded of the city's incredible ability to rise from the ashes. It required painstaking rebuilding, and its resilience and determination are evident everywhere. On 9 November 1940, Warsaw was rightfully awarded Poland's highest military decoration for heroism, the Virtuti Militari, during the courageous Siege of Warsaw in 1939.

Therefore, the inherent intractability of a problem remains somewhat unaffected by technological progress.\n\nHowever, it's worth noting that a polynomial time algorithm, while generally considered practical, may not always be efficient.

However, she is pleased to see that average teacher salaries have been improving rapidly in recent years. Amanda knows that in the United States, teacher salaries are generally determined based on graduated scales, taking into account factors such as experience and level of education. She is aware that teachers with more experience and higher education tend to earn higher salaries compared to those with just a standard bachelor's degree and certificate.\n\nAmanda understands that teacher salaries can vary greatly depending on the state, relative cost of living, and the grade they teach. She knows that affluent suburban school districts often have higher salary schedules compared to other districts. Amanda remembers that back in 2004, the median salary for all primary and secondary teachers was $46,000, with entry-level teachers earning an estimated $32,000. She is also aware that preschool teachers, unfortunately, had median salaries less than half of what secondary teachers earned, amounting to approximately $21,000 in 2004.\n\nAmanda realizes that as a high school teacher, she needs to be mindful of the salary differences across states. In 2007, she learned that high school teachers in South Dakota earned median salaries of $35,000, while those in New York earned an impressive $71,000. The national median for high school teachers was $52,000. Luckily, Amanda's teaching contract includes benefits such as long-term disability insurance, life insurance, and emergency/personal leave, giving her some peace of mind.\n\nIn 2006-2007, the American Federation of Teachers conducted a salary survey, revealing that the average teacher salary was $51,009. Looking at the K-12 teacher salary survey report, Amanda noticed that elementary school teachers had the lowest median salary, earning $39,259, while high school teachers had the highest median salary, earning $41,855.\n\nAlthough Amanda's main motivation is her love for teaching, she also takes advantage of other opportunities to increase her income. She is involved in supervising after-school programs and participating in extracurricular activities. Amanda appreciates that in addition to monetary compensation, public school teachers like her often enjoy greater benefits such as health insurance, which may not be available in other occupations.\n\nOne exciting trend that Amanda has noticed is the rise of merit pay systems for teachers. These systems reward teachers with extra money based on excellent classroom evaluations, high test scores, and overall success at their school. Amanda finds this approach encouraging, as it acknowledges the dedication and hard work she puts into her teaching.\n\nFurthermore, Amanda has joined the growing number of teachers who are leveraging the internet to supplement their income. She has become a member of TeachersPayTeachers.com, a platform where she can sell her well-crafted lesson plans to other teachers.

These traditions include individuals like the starets or elder, who is typically a man (sometimes a woman) and often a monastic, blessed with special gifts from God. They play a crucial role in guiding souls and helping detect and correct spiritual pride or deception in the Orthodox Catholic tradition, particularly in Russian Orthodoxy. In Roman Catholicism, the role of spiritual guide or father is usually fulfilled by a Priest or Confessor, who is commonly ordained but may also be a highly respected monastic or individual with spiritual wisdom. Even the Pope of Rome has a Confessor, although this position does not necessarily hold equal authority. On the other hand, Protestant and Non-Denominational traditions tend to have a less formal approach when it comes to spiritual guidance. Their mentorship arrangements, often informal and occasionally formal in cases of church discipline, are more prevalent, especially in the guidance of both adults and children. In such traditions, the role of a youth pastor may also overlap with that of a mentor. However, it is worth mentioning that some of the more traditional and conservative Reformation Churches, such as certain Lutheran and Anglican churches, display elements similar to the Roman \"confessor\" position.

Similar to the Protestant traditions, there is a strong emphasis on the husband and father within an LDS family to provide spiritual guidance to their entire family. It is preferred that the husband seeks consultation with his wife, regardless of whether the husband is a member of the LDS Church or not.

Collaborating closely with the newly appointed elector, John the Steadfast, Luther sought secular leadership and financial support for a church that had lost much of its wealth and income following the split from Rome. This partnership, according to Martin Brecht, Luther's biographer, unintentionally set the stage for a new form of church government under the temporal sovereign. The elector granted Luther the authority to conduct church visitations, a responsibility previously reserved for bishops. While Luther's practical reforms sometimes fell short of his earlier radical statements, Martin Luther's Instructions for the Visitors of Parish Pastors in Electoral Saxony (1528), drafted with Luther's approval by Melanchthon, emphasized the role of repentance in the forgiveness of sins, despite Luther's belief in the primacy of faith for justification.

Luther's German Mass was based on the Catholic service but intentionally excluded any elements that resembled sacrificial practices. This new Mass became a joyous celebration where ordinary individuals were able to partake in both the wine and the bread. While Luther retained certain rituals like the elevation of the host and chalice, he made aspects such as Mass vestments, the use of an altar, and candles optional, allowing a sense of freedom in the ceremony. Some reformers, including followers of Huldrych Zwingli, criticized Luther's service for still appearing too similar to Catholic traditions. However, modern scholars acknowledge the conservative nature of Luther's alternative to the Catholic Mass. Notably, Luther's German Mass incorporated congregational singing of hymns and psalms in the German language, as well as the inclusion of Luther's own unison setting of the Creed within the liturgy.

Seeking approval, Philip approached Luther, Melanchthon, and Bucer, citing the polygamy practices followed by the patriarchs as a precedent. Understanding the complexity of the matter, the theologians were reluctant to issue a sweeping ruling. Instead, they cautiously advised the landgrave that if he was resolved in his decision, he should pursue a discreet marriage and refrain from publicizing it. Consequently, on March 4, 1540, Philip entered into a clandestine marriage with Margarethe von der Saale, with both Melanchthon and Bucer bearing witness to the ceremony. However, Philip proved incapable of maintaining the secrecy surrounding the union and began to threaten exposing Luther's involvement. In response, Luther, suggesting a questionable path, urged Philip to fabricate a convincing falsehood and deny the existence of the marriage altogether. Ultimately, Philip followed this advice during the subsequent public controversy. Martin Brecht, a renowned biographer of Luther, firmly believes that Luther's decision to counsel Philip regarding his religious beliefs was among his most regrettable errors. Brecht, as well as many other historians, primarily place the blame on Philip himself for initiating the situation but also consider Luther accountable for his part in the matter. According to Brecht, Luther's mistake was not necessarily in providing private pastoral guidance, but rather misjudging the potential political repercussions.

While his theological standpoint regarded Jews as blasphemers and liars due to their rejection of the divinity of Jesus, Christians believed Jesus to be the Messiah. However, Luther also believed that all individuals who opposed God were equally condemned. As early as 1516, he noted that many people displayed arrogance and ignorance by labeling Jews as dogs or evildoers, without realizing their own shortcomings in the eyes of God. In 1523, Luther advocated for compassion towards Jews in his work \"That Jesus Christ was Born a Jew,\" intending to convert them to Christianity.

These works were published in 1543, just three years prior to Luther's death. In these writings, Luther expressed his controversial belief that the Jews were no longer the chosen people, but rather, he referred to them as \"the devil's people\" and used inflammatory language to depict them. Drawing from Deuteronomy 13, where Moses orders the execution of idolaters and the destruction of their cities and belongings as an offering to God, Luther advocated for what he termed \"sharp mercy\" against the Jews, hoping that some could be saved from eternal damnation. His proposed measures included burning synagogues, confiscating Jewish property and funds, suppressing rabbinical teachings, and demolishing Jewish homes, all with the intention of forcing the Jewish community into labor or permanent expulsion. Scholars like Robert Michael argue that Luther's statement \"We are at fault in not slaying them\" can be interpreted as a justification for murder.

In this setting, Hugues, despite being Catholic, emerged as a leader of the \"Confederate Party.\" This name was given to the political faction advocating for independence from the Duke of Savoy through an alliance between the city-state of Geneva and the Swiss Confederation. The term \"Huguenot\" supposedly gained prominence in France when it was used to label the conspirators involved in the Amboise plot of 1560, all of whom were aristocratic members of the Reformed Church. However, their plan to seize power from the influential House of Guise and form an alliance with the Swiss ultimately failed.

It consists of one or more rotors, known as rotating discs, which are mounted on a drive shaft. These rotating discs alternate with a series of stators, referred to as static discs, which are fixed to the turbine casing. At the outer edge of the rotors, there is a propeller-like arrangement of blades. When steam acts upon these blades, it produces rotary motion. The stators, on the other hand, have a similar series of blades, but these blades are fixed. The purpose of the stators is to redirect the steam flow to the next rotor stage.\n\nTo create a vacuum, a steam turbine often exhausts into a surface condenser. The arrangement of stages in a steam turbine is carefully designed to extract the maximum potential work from steam of a specific velocity and pressure. This design includes a series of variably sized high- and low-pressure stages. For efficient performance, turbines need to rotate at relatively high speeds. Hence, they are usually connected to reduction gearing in order to drive lower speed applications, such as a ship's propeller. However, in large electric generating stations, turbines are directly connected to generators without any reduction gearing. In the USA, the typical operating speed is 3600 revolutions per minute (RPM) with 60 Hertz power, while in Europe and other countries, it is 3000 RPM with 50 Hertz power.\n\nIn nuclear power applications, the turbine speeds are usually half of the aforementioned speeds, which means 1800 RPM and 1500 RPM, respectively.

Mayow's experiments focused on the intricate nature of fire, revealing that it only necessitates a specific component of air known as spiritus nitroaereus or simply nitroaereus.

These treaties establish the institutions of the EU, outline their powers and responsibilities, and define the areas in which the EU can create legislation through Directives or Regulations. The European Commission takes the lead in proposing legislation, while the Council (comprised of ministers from member state governments) and the European Parliament (elected by citizens) have the authority to introduce amendments and must provide their consent for laws to be enacted. To ensure compliance with EU law, the Commission supervises various departments and agencies entrusted with the execution and enforcement of these laws. In addition, the \"European Council\" (consisting of the Prime Ministers or executive Presidents of member states) appoints the Commissioners and the board of the European Central Bank. Meanwhile, the European Court of Justice serves as the highest judicial body responsible for interpreting EU law and shaping its development through the establishment of legal precedents.

According to the TEU, EU law is applicable to the mainland territories of the member states, as well as specific islands and overseas territories such as Madeira, the Canary Islands, and the French overseas departments. Additionally, it extends to territories where a member state has external relations responsibilities, such as Gibraltar and the \u00c5land islands. The TEU allows the European Council to make specific provisions for regions, such as the customs matters in Gibraltar and Saint-Pierre-et-Miquelon. However, certain regions like the Faroe Islands are explicitly excluded from the jurisdiction of EU law. The treaties become effective as soon as they are enforced, unless stated otherwise, and are generally valid indefinitely. The TEU stipulates that commitments made between member states before the signing of the treaty no longer hold. All EU member states are obliged to adhere to the principle of cooperation, as stated in the TEU, which prohibits any actions that might jeopardize the achievement of the treaty's objectives.

While the Commission holds a monopoly on initiating legislation, the European Parliament and the Council of the European Union do have some powers of amendment and veto during the legislative process. However, it is concerning that the elected representatives in the Parliament cannot initiate legislation against the Commission's wishes. Moreover, the voting weight of citizens from the smallest countries in the Parliament is ten times that of citizens from the largest countries, which undermines the principle of equality.\n\nTo make matters worse, the Council's decision-making process requires \"qualified majorities\" or consensus, which further limits the ability of citizens to participate in the legislative process. This is often justified by the need for technical coordination and the historical context of post-war Europe. However, it is disheartening to see that citizens' rights are limited compared to those in the democratic polities of European member states.\n\nWhile there have been some positive developments over time, such as the Parliament gradually gaining more voice through direct elections, citizens still face limitations on their rights. Initiatives with one million signatures can be submitted to the Commission, but their consideration is not guaranteed. Citizens also have the right to petition the Parliament on issues affecting them, but the extent of their influence remains uncertain.\n\nIt is worth noting that Parliament elections take place every five years, and proportional representation or a single transferable vote system is used to organize the votes for Members of the European Parliament. The number of MEPs is \"degressively proportional\" to the size of the member state, which means that citizens from smaller member states have a greater voice compared to citizens from larger member states.\n\nThe conservative European People's Party currently holds the largest number of seats in the Parliament, while the Party of European Socialists leads the opposition. However, it is important to mention that parties in the Parliament do not receive public funds from the EU, as that is regulated by the member states.\n\nThe Parliament does have some powers, such as calling inquiries into maladministration and appointing an Ombudsman. It can also require the Commission to respond to questions and, with a two-thirds majority, censure the entire Commission.

This procedure consists of three readings, with the initial step being a Commission proposal. In order to block or suggest changes to the proposed legislation, the Parliament must vote by a majority of all Members of the European Parliament (MEPs), rather than just those present. On the other hand, the Council needs to vote by a qualified majority to approve changes, but unanimity is required to block any amendments suggested by the Commission.\n\nIn case there is a deadlock between the different institutions involved, a \"Conciliation Committee\" is formed. This committee represents MEPs, ministers, and the Commission, and its purpose is to facilitate agreement on a joint text. If successful, the agreed-upon text is then sent back to the Parliament and Council to be approved by absolute and qualified majority.\n\nIt is essential to note that this means legislation can be blocked by a majority in Parliament, a minority in the Council, and a majority in the Commission. Consequently, changing EU law is a more difficult task compared to maintaining the status quo.\n\nFurthermore, it is crucial to differentiate the procedure for budgets, as there exists a separate process. For any \"enhanced cooperation\" among a specific group of member states, the Council must authorize it. Additionally, the Commission is required to inform member state governments at the onset, before any proposals enter the legislative procedure.\n\nIt is noteworthy that the EU can only act within the powers granted to it by the Treaties. TEU articles 4 and 5 state that powers inherently belong to the member states unless specifically conferred. Nevertheless, there is an ongoing debate regarding the Kompetenz-Kompetenz question, which addresses who ultimately holds the authority to define the EU's jurisdiction.

Within the CJEU, there are different courts such as the higher European Court of Justice (ECJ) that handles cases of public importance, the General Court that focuses on intricate matters, and the Civil Service Tribunal that addresses EU staff issues. Additionally, there is a separate Court of Auditors. According to the Treaty on European Union article 19(2), each member state appoints one judge, currently totaling 28, who must possess the necessary qualifications for the highest judicial offices. The judges elect a president who serves a three-year term. Article 19(3) establishes the CJEU as the ultimate authority for interpreting EU law.

The primary duty of the CJEU is to ensure that the law is observed in the interpretation and application of the Treaties.

In this regard, the Court of Justice firmly upholds the principle that if EU law clashes with a provision of national law, EU law takes precedence. This principle was reaffirmed in the landmark case of Costa v ENEL in 1964. In this case, Mr Costa, a Milanese lawyer and former shareholder of an energy company, refused to pay his electricity bill as a form of protest against the nationalization of the Italian energy corporations. Mr Costa contended that the Italian nationalization law contradicted the Treaty of Rome and sought a reference to both the Italian Constitutional Court and the Court of Justice under TFEU article 267. The Italian Constitutional Court opined that Costa's claim was not tenable since the nationalization law preceded the treaty. Conversely, the Court of Justice asserted that the Treaty of Rome did not prohibit energy nationalization and clarified that only the Commission could have initiated legal action, not Mr Costa. Nonetheless, the Court recognized Mr Costa's right to raise an argument regarding the conflict between the Treaty and national law, obligating the court to consider his claim and make a reference in the absence of any appeal against its decision. Echoing its stance in the Van Gend en Loos case, the Court of Justice emphasized that member states had voluntarily limited their sovereign rights, establishing a body of law that applies to both nationals and themselves, based on reciprocity. The Court emphasized that EU law cannot be overridden by domestic provisions without undermining the legal foundation of the EU itself. Accordingly, any subsequent unilateral act of a member state would be deemed inapplicable. Similarly, in the case of Amministrazione delle Finanze v Simmenthal SpA, Simmenthal SpA, an importing company, challenged an Italian law imposing a public health inspection fee for importing beef from France in 1970, citing conflicting Regulations from 1964 and 1968. The Court of Justice, guided by the precedence of Community law, asserted that directly applicable measures from EU institutions, such as the Regulations in question, automatically render any conflicting national provisions inapplicable.

More recently, the UK Supreme Court recognized in the R (HS2 Action Alliance Ltd) v Secretary of State for Transport case that although the UK constitution is not codified, there exist \"fundamental principles\" of common law, which were neither anticipated nor authorized to be abolished when the European Communities Act 1972 was enacted. The German Constitutional Court's position, as expressed in the Solange I and Solange II decisions, is that if the EU fails to adhere to its fundamental constitutional rights and principles, specifically democracy, the rule of law, and principles of the social state, it cannot supersede German law. Nevertheless, as the nicknames of these judgments imply, as long as the EU makes efforts towards democratizing its institutions and establishes a framework that safeguards fundamental human rights, it would not subject EU legislation to review for compatibility with German constitutional principles.

According to this case, it was determined that the provisions of the Treaties, as well as EU Regulations, are directly effective if they meet certain criteria: they must be clear, unambiguous, unconditional, and not require any further action from EU or national authorities for implementation.\n\nOne practical example of this is when Van Gend en Loos, a postal company, argued that what is now known as TFEU article 30 prevented Dutch Customs Authorities from charging tariffs on urea-formaldehyde plastics imported from Germany to the Netherlands. After the case was referred to the Court of Justice, it was ruled that even though the Treaties did not explicitly grant the right for citizens or companies to bring claims, they still had this right.

Member states are also under an obligation not to duplicate Regulations in their own laws to avoid confusion. This was evident in the case of Commission v Italy, where Italy breached its duty under the Treaties by both failing to establish a scheme to pay farmers for slaughtering cows to reduce dairy overproduction, and by replicating the rules in a decree with additional provisions. The Court of Justice clarified that Regulations come into force solely through publication, and any implementation measures that deviate from their uniform application across the Union could jeopardize their effectiveness.\n\nHowever, it should be noted that certain Regulations might explicitly require specific implementing measures, and in those cases, it is necessary to adhere to those particular rules.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 228, "text": "Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen"}, {"answer_start": 228, "text": "Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen"}, {"answer_start": 228, "text": "Van Gend en Loos v Nederlandse Administratie der Belastingen"}], "question": "In which case was it held that the provisions of the treaties are directly effective if they are clear, unconditional, and don't require further action by EU or national authorities?", "id": "57269bb8708984140094cb95"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 698, "text": "article 30"}, {"answer_start": 693, "text": "TFEU article 30"}, {"answer_start": 693, "text": "TFEU article 30"}], "question": "Which TEFU article states that no quantitative restrictions can be placed on trade?", "id": "57269bb8708984140094cb96"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 642, "text": "a postal company"}, {"answer_start": 642, "text": "a postal company"}, {"answer_start": 642, "text": "a postal company"}], "question": "What type of company is Van Gend en Loos?", "id": "57269bb8708984140094cb97"}]}, {"context": "As a legal expert, it is important to note that while the Treaties and Regulations can directly impact individuals, Directives usually do not provide citizens with the ability to sue each other.

In such a situation, a citizen, like Mr Ratti, who owns a solvent and varnish business, can rely on the Directive (in this case, Directive 73/173/EEC on packaging and labelling solvents) to challenge the enforcement of conflicting national laws. This happened in the Pubblico Ministero v Ratti case, where the Italian government's failure to implement the Directive led to the inability to enforce a national law against Mr Ratti's business. The court held that the member state cannot use its own failure to meet Directive obligations against individuals or businesses.\n\nMoreover, it is worth noting that not only public authorities but also citizens or companies can invoke a Directive in disputes with other citizens or companies. This was demonstrated in the CIA Security v Signalson and Securitel case, where CIA Security successfully defended itself against allegations of non-compliance with a Belgian decree on alarm systems. The company argued that the decree had not been notified to the Commission as required by a Directive. The court affirmed that a Directive can be invoked by a citizen or company in any dispute, not limited to those involving public authorities.\n\nFurthermore, when a Directive reflects a \"general principle\" of EU law, it can be invoked by private parties even before the implementation deadline. The K\u00fcc\u00fckdeveci v Swedex GmbH & Co KG case serves as an example. Ms K\u00fcc\u00fckdeveci, who had worked for 10 years for Swedex GmbH & Co KG, claimed that the German Civil Code's provision of not counting her years under age 25 towards statutory notice before dismissal was age discrimination. The Court of Justice upheld her claim, stating that the Employment Equality Framework Directive could be relied upon by her because equality was considered a general principle of EU law.\n\nLastly, it is important to note that even if the defendant is not a central government entity but an emanation of the state (such as a public service provider with special powers), they can still be bound by Directives. Foster v British Gas plc exemplifies this, where Mrs Foster successfully brought a sex discrimination claim against her employer, British Gas plc, which had different retirement ages for men and women. The court ruled that if specific conditions were met, including the service provider being subject to a state measure, providing a public service, and having special powers, then the defendant could be held liable under Directives. This principle also extends to privatized enterprises responsible for essential services, as seen in the case involving a water company responsible for basic water provision.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 1559, "text": "10 years"}, {"answer_start": 1559, "text": "10 years"}, {"answer_start": 1559, "text": "10 years"}], "question": "How long did Ms Kucukdeveci work for Swedex Gmbh & Co KG before she was dismissed?", "id": "57269e3bf1498d1400e8e518"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 2162, "text": "British Gas plc"}, {"answer_start": 2162, "text": "British Gas plc"}, {"answer_start": 2162, "text": "British Gas plc"}], "question": "Which company did Mrs Foster work for?", "id": "57269e3bf1498d1400e8e519"}]}, {"context": "According to legal principles, national courts have the responsibility to interpret their own laws in a manner that aligns with the intentions and requirements of EU directives. This approach, often referred to as \"indirect effect\", was established in the case of Marleasing SA v La Comercial SA. In this case, the Court of Justice ruled that a Spanish court had to interpret its general Civil Code provisions related to contracts lacking cause or defrauding creditors in accordance with Article 11 of the First Company Law Directive. This directive specified that incorporations would only be nullified for a fixed list of reasons.\n\nNevertheless, it should be noted that the duty of interpretation cannot contradict the clear and explicit language of the national legislation.\n\nFurthermore, if a member state fails to implement a directive, individuals may face difficulties in holding non-state parties accountable. However, they do have the right to take legal action against the member state itself for its failure to fulfill its obligations. This was exemplified in the case of Francovich v Italy, where the Italian government failed to establish an insurance fund, as required by the Insolvency Protection Directive, for employees to claim unpaid wages in the event of employer insolvency. As a result, the former employee, Mr. Francovich, who worked for a bankrupt Venetian firm, was able to seek compensation of 6 million Lira from the Italian government. The Court of Justice ruled that if a directive confers specific rights on individuals and there is a clear link between the member state's violation of EU law and the claimant's losses, the member state is obligated to pay damages.

Within the realm of European Union law, legal certainty entails that laws must be clear, precise, and foreseeable, especially when it comes to financial obligations. It is crucial that any legislation with legal implications in the European Union has a solid legal foundation. Furthermore, member states' implementation of European Union law must draft their legislation in a manner that is easily comprehensible for those subject to it. In the context of European Union law, the principle of legal certainty also prohibits retroactive laws, meaning laws should not take effect before being published.

According to the widely accepted theory of comparative advantage, countries can mutually benefit from trade, even if one has a less productive economy overall. This principle is applicable not only to regional organizations like the North American Free Trade Agreement and the World Trade Organization but also to the European Union. By reducing barriers to trade and facilitating the free movement of goods, services, labor, and capital, the intention is to lower consumer prices in the EU. It was initially theorized that a free trade area would progress to become a customs union, followed by a common market, monetary union, fiscal and political integration, ultimately resembling a federal state. However, the European integration process deviated from this predicted sequence, resulting in a unique mixture of stages. Consequently, it remains unclear whether the final objective should align with the conventional understanding of a state. In practical terms, while free trade can yield benefits for certain parties, especially large businesses, it can also place undue burdens on those lacking bargaining power within an expanding market, such as workers, consumers, small businesses, developing industries, and local communities. The Treaties of the European Union establish the principle of free movement of goods (Articles 28 to 37) as well as the free movement of persons, services, and capital (Articles 45 to 66). These principles, commonly referred to as the \"four freedoms,\" were hindered by physical, technical, and fiscal barriers, including customs restrictions, variances in safety regulations, consumer protections, environmental standards, and Value Added Tax rates. The legislation aims to strike a delicate balance, ensuring that free movement and trade do not become a license for unrestricted commercial profit. Instead, the Treaties prioritize other values such as public health, consumer protection, labor rights, fair competition, and environmental sustainability.

In this particular case, French farmer vigilantes continually sabotaged shipments of Spanish strawberries and Belgian tomato imports, which hindered trade within the customs union. As authorities in France \"manifestly and persistently abstained\" from preventing this sabotage, it resulted in France being held liable for these actions.\n\nFurthermore, it is important to note that the principle of non-discrimination plays a significant role in maintaining the smooth flow of goods within the European Union. Member states must adhere to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union article 34, which prohibits quantitative restrictions on imports and any measures having an equivalent effect between Member States. This principle was established in the Procureur du Roi v Dassonville case, where it was determined that any \"trading rules\" enacted by Member States that could potentially hinder trade directly or indirectly would be caught by article 34. This ruling had significant implications for parallel importers like Mr Dassonville, who faced discrimination due to a Belgian law requiring certification of origin for Scotch whisky imports that could not be obtained from French authorities.\n\nIt is worth mentioning that member states have the responsibility to justify any laws or practices that directly discriminate against imports or exports under TFEU article 35. These justifications can include public morality, policy or security, protection of health and life, national treasures, industrial and commercial property, as well as environmental protection as an overriding requirement derived from TFEU article 11. Additionally, the Court of Justice has recognized the importance of prioritizing fundamental human rights over trade rules. This was evident in the Schmidberger v Austria case, where Austria's decision not to ban a protest that blocked heavy traffic passing over the A13, Brenner Autobahn, en route to Italy was deemed acceptable as it protected the fundamental pillar of freedom of association.\n\nIn the event that a member state appeals to the article 36 justification, it is imperative for them to ensure that the measures taken are proportionate. This means that the rule must pursue a legitimate aim, be suitable and necessary to achieve that aim, and be reasonable in balancing the interests of free trade with the interests specified in article 36.

It is evident that this measure infringes on the principles laid out in article 34, as it disproportionately affects importers and restricts the access of motorcycles and mopeds with trailers to the Italian market.

One important case that illustrates the delicate balance between preventing cut throat competition and promoting free trade is Keck and Mithouard. In this case, two importers challenged a French competition law that prohibited them from selling Picon beer below wholesale price. The Court of Justice ruled that this law, considered as a \"selling arrangement,\" did not fall under TFEU article 34 since it equally affected all sellers and aimed to prevent cut throat competition rather than restrict trade. This decision highlights the distinction between measures that alter a product's content and those that regulate selling arrangements.\n\nFurthermore, the Court of Justice has also ruled on cases involving advertising restrictions. In Konsumentombudsmannen v De Agostini, the Swedish bans on advertising to children under age 12 and misleading commercials for skin care products were reviewed. Although the bans were upheld as justifiable under article 36 or as mandatory requirements, the Court emphasized that complete marketing bans could be disproportionate if advertising was the only effective form of promotion for traders to penetrate the market. Similarly, in Konsumentombudsmannen v Gourmet AB, a total ban on advertising alcohol through radio, TV, and magazines was considered under article 34. The Court acknowledged that if advertising was the only way for sellers to overcome consumers' traditional social practices and local habits, such a ban could be justified to protect public health.\n\nTo address unfair commercial practices, the EU implemented the Unfair Commercial Practices Directive, which harmonizes restrictions on marketing and advertising. This directive prohibits conduct that distorts average consumer behavior, is misleading or aggressive, and provides a list of examples of what constitutes unfair practices. The aim is to establish minimum standards of best practice and prevent a regulatory \"race to the bottom\" while ensuring consumers have access to goods from across the continent.

Originally, the European Community focused on the free movement of workers as a means to drive economic growth. However, there has been a shift towards creating a more socially inclusive Europe since the 1970s. This shift has led to an emphasis on \"citizenship,\" granting individuals the necessary rights and empowerment to participate economically and socially, regardless of their economic contributions. It is important to note that the specific rights granted to workers, as outlined in Article 45 of the TFEU, are a manifestation of the broader rights held by citizens, detailed in Articles 18 to 21. According to the Court of Justice, the definition of a \"worker\" encompasses anyone engaged in economic activity, including those in employment relationships where they receive remuneration and work under the direction of another person. This definition also extends to unpaid work as long as there is some form of indirect compensation. Having \"worker\" status affords individuals protection against discrimination by governments and employers, guaranteeing access to employment, tax benefits, and social security. On the other hand, \"citizenship\" refers to individuals who hold the nationality of a Member State, granting them the right to seek employment and participate in local and European elections, albeit with more limited access to social security benefits.

These articles ensure that workers have the right to take up employment, enter into contracts, and are protected against discrimination compared to nationals of the member state. One notable case that exemplifies the importance of these provisions is Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute, where a Dutch national, Mr. Hendrix, was denied incapacity benefits when he moved to Belgium. The Court of Justice determined that the benefit was closely linked to the socio-economic situation of the Netherlands, justifying the denial. This highlights the need to consider the specific circumstances when determining equal treatment.\n\nSimilarly, in the famous Belgian Football Association v Bosman case, Jean-Marc Bosman argued that he should be allowed to transfer from R.F.C. de Li\u00e8ge to USL Dunkerque, regardless of transfer fees. The Court of Justice ruled that these transfer rules constituted an obstacle to free movement, and unless they could be justified in the public interest, they were considered unlawful. This case emphasized the significance of free movement and non-discrimination within the realm of employment.\n\nAnother crucial aspect of equal treatment is the requirement of equal tax benefits, as mentioned in article 7(2) of the regulation. In Finanzamt K\u00f6ln Altstadt v Schumacker, the Court of Justice deemed it a contravention of TFEU art 45 to deny tax benefits to a man who worked in Germany but resided in Belgium, while his German counterparts received these benefits. On the other hand, in Weigel v Finanzlandesdirektion f\u00fcr Vorarlberg, Mr. Weigel's claim that a re-registration charge for bringing his car to Austria violated his right to free movement was rejected by the Court of Justice. The charge applied equally to Austrians, and in the absence of EU legislation on the matter, it was considered justified.\n\nLastly, equal treatment regarding \"social advantages\" is a fundamental principle. In Geven v Land Nordrhein-Westfalen, a Dutch woman working part-time in Germany was not entitled to receive German child benefits, whereas the wife of a man working full-time in Germany but residing in Austria could. The Court of Justice justified this discrepancy by stating that the benefits were closely related to the socio-economic situation of each country. This decision demonstrates how different factors may impact the entitlement to social advantages.\n\nOverall, these cases and provisions highlight the need for equal treatment and non-discrimination within the European Union, while considering specific circumstances and justifications outlined in TFEU article 45(3) and (4).", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 119, "text": "articles 1 to 7"}, {"answer_start": 119, "text": "articles 1 to 7"}, {"answer_start": 119, "text": "articles 1 to 7"}], "question": "Which articles of the Free Movement of Workers Regulation set out the primary provisions on equal treatment of workers?", "id": "5726bc1add62a815002e8ea6"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 430, "text": "Hendrix v Employee"}, {"answer_start": 430, "text": "Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute"}, {"answer_start": 430, "text": "Hendrix v Employee Insurance Institute"}], "question": "In which case was a Dutch national not entitled to continue receiving benefits when he moved to Belgium?", "id": "5726bc1add62a815002e8ea9"}]}, {"context": "The Court of Justice has recognized the significance of Citizenship of the EU as a crucial status for individuals belonging to member states.

This meant that a lawyer from Stuttgart, who had established legal chambers in Milan and faced reprimand from the Milan Bar Council for not being registered, was entitled to bring a claim under the freedom of establishment rather than the freedom to provide services. However, it was specified that the requirement for registration in Milan, in order to practice law, would only be permissible if such requirements were non-discriminatory and could be justified by imperative reasons in the general interest while being proportionately applied.\n\nAccording to the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), article 49, all individuals or entities engaged in economic activities, including the self-employed and companies, have the right to establish and operate a business without undue restrictions.

This principle was evident in the case of Reyners v Belgium, where the Court of Justice ruled that denying admission to the Belgian bar for a lawyer due to their lack of Belgian nationality was an unjustifiable restriction. While TFEU article 49 exempts states from violating the freedom of establishment when exercising \"official authority,\" it was clarified that the work of an advocate, as distinct from that of a court, did not fall within the realm of \"official authority.\"\n\nOn the contrary, in the case of Commission v Italy, the Court of Justice held that the requirement for lawyers in Italy to adhere to maximum tariffs unless there was a prior agreement with a client did not constitute a restriction.

The incident prompted Dimas and the Justice, Freedom and Security Commissioner, Franco Frattini, to propose the implementation of criminal penalties for \"ecological crimes\". However, the jurisdiction of the European Union to legislate in criminal law was challenged in 2005, leading to a legal battle that was ultimately won by the Commission. This ruling set a precedent, allowing the Commission to legislate on a supranational level in criminal law, which was an unprecedented development.

Some members of the European Parliament opposed this legislation, arguing that criminal law should not fall under the competence of the EU, but their objections were ultimately rejected.

According to Dutch legislation, only individuals established in the Netherlands are permitted to provide legal advice. This restriction has hindered my ability to continue assisting a client in a social security case after moving to Belgium. However, the Court of Justice has recognized the applicability of the \"freedom to provide services\" under TFEU article 56 to people in my position. They have deemed this freedom to be directly effective and raised doubts about the justification of the Dutch law. The court suggests that having an address in the member state should be sufficient to pursue the legitimate aim of ensuring good administration of justice. Despite this, the Court of Justice has also clarified that secondary education falls outside the scope of article 56, as it is usually funded by the state. However, higher education does fall within its scope. Additionally, health care is generally considered a service. In a case involving Mrs. Geraets-Smits and the Dutch social insurance, it was argued that the freedom is restricted when a patient seeks treatment abroad and faces obstacles from national authorities. The Dutch health authorities had deemed the treatment received by Mrs. Geraets-Smits in Germany unnecessary, thereby limiting the freedom of the German health clinic to provide services. The Court of Justice acknowledged health care as a \"service,\" regardless of whether the service recipient or the government pays for it. National authorities may refuse to reimburse patients for medical services abroad if the health care received in the patient's home country is without undue delay and follows internationally recognized medical science regarding what treatments are considered normal and necessary. It is also worth noting that the Court requires individual circumstances to justify waiting lists, even within the context of the UK's National Health Service. Another area of services that raises sensitivity is illegal activities. In a case involving cannabis consumption in the Netherlands, the Court of Justice concluded that the regulation of narcotics, including the prohibition on tourists visiting coffee shops (but not Dutch nationals), falls outside the scope of article 56. The court reasoning was based on the fact that narcotic drugs are controlled in all member states, making it distinct from cases involving quasi-legal activities or prostitution that are subject to restrictions. If an activity is indeed within the scope of article 56, restrictions can still be justified under article 52 or overriding requirements developed by the Court of Justice. This was demonstrated in the case involving a Dutch law prohibiting cold calling customers by a business that sold commodities futures. The Court of Justice affirmed that the Dutch prohibition aimed to prevent undesirable developments in securities trading and protected consumers from aggressive sales tactics, thereby maintaining confidence in the Dutch markets. Similarly, in a case involving a \"laserdrome\" business banned by the Bonn council, the Court of Justice upheld the ban based on the German constitutional value of human dignity. This ban was deemed a justified restriction on the freedom to provide services. Finally, in a case concerning the state monopoly on gambling and penalties imposed on a Gibraltar firm offering internet gambling services, the Court of Justice justified these measures as necessary to prevent fraud and regulate gambling when there are divergent opinions among people. The ban on internet gambling was considered proportionate and an appropriate means of addressing the serious fraud issues arising online.

One such case involved the Daily Mail newspaper's parent company attempting to evade tax by relocating its business to the Netherlands. However, the Court of Justice ruled in R (Daily Mail and General Trust plc) v HM Treasury that member states have the authority to restrict companies from moving their seats of business in order to ensure tax compliance. This decision protected the public interest in collecting taxes and upheld the principle of creditor protection.\n\nIn another case, Centros Ltd v Erhversus-og Selkabssyrelsen, a UK-based company operating in Denmark was challenged to comply with Denmark's minimum share capital rules. While UK law allowed companies to start with a nominal capital of \u00a31, Denmark required a more substantial amount to protect creditors in case of insolvency. The Court of Justice determined that Denmark's minimum capital law infringed upon Centros Ltd's freedom of establishment, as it deemed the requirement unnecessary and restrictive. This case sparked concerns about potential regulatory competition and a potential decline in standards across the EU.\n\nA similar case, \u00dcberseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH, examined the right of establishment for foreign companies in Germany. The Court of Justice ruled that a German court could not deny a Dutch building company the right to enforce a contract in Germany solely because it was not validly incorporated in Germany. While restrictions on freedom of establishment could be justified for reasons such as creditor protection, labor rights, and tax collection, denying capacity to a foreign company was considered an extreme measure that completely negated the right of establishment.\n\nOn the other hand, the case of Cartesio Oktat\u00f3 \u00e9s Szolg\u00e1ltat\u00f3 bt highlighted the authority of a state to determine the conditions for companies incorporated within its territory.

They have a varied diet, incorporating their prey's nematocysts (stinging cells) into their own tentacles instead of using colloblasts. These fascinating creatures have a voracious appetite when food is abundant, as they can consume up to 10 times their own weight per day. While some ctenophores like Beroe primarily prey on other ctenophores, there are other surface-water species that feed on zooplankton, including microscopic mollusc and fish larvae, as well as small adult crustaceans such as copepods, amphipods, and even krill. The genus Haeckelia has a unique feeding strategy, as they prey on jellyfish and employ their prey's nematocysts to capture their own food. This phylum exhibits a wide range of hunting techniques, similar to spiders, including hanging immobile in the water like a web, ambushing like Salticid jumping spiders, or dangling a sticky droplet like bolas spiders. This diversity in feeding methods explains the wide range of body forms within this relatively small species-rich phylum. One particular ctenophore species, the two-tentacled \"cydippid\" Lampea, exclusively feeds on salps, which are chain-like floating colonies closely related to sea-squirts. Interestingly, juvenile Lampea attach themselves to larger salps, acting as parasites until they are large enough to consume their host. Furthermore, the cydippid genus Pleurobrachia and lobate Bolinopsis often coexist in high numbers due to their specialization in different types of prey. Pleurobrachia, with its long tentacles, primarily captures adult copepods, while Bolinopsis prefers to feed on smaller, weaker swimmers such as rotifers and mollusc and crustacean larvae.

However, in-depth research on chum salmon revealed that these fish can digest ctenophores 20 times faster than an equal weight of shrimps. This indicates that ctenophores can serve as a nutritious diet if their abundance is sufficient. Beroids primarily prey on other ctenophores. Additionally, certain jellyfish and turtles consume substantial quantities of ctenophores, sometimes resulting in temporary population declines. Given the significant seasonal variations in the population of ctenophores and jellyfish, most fish that feed on them are adaptable generalists, potentially having a more pronounced impact on populations compared to specialist jelly-eaters.

Interestingly, these three species did not possess tentacles like their modern counterparts, but had significantly more comb rows ranging from 24 to 80, which is far greater than the usual 8 seen in living species. Additionally, they seemed to have internal structures resembling organs that are not found in present-day ctenophores. Notably, one of the fossil species reported in 1996 exhibited a large mouth, possibly surrounded by a muscular folded edge.

Studies examining gene families and signaling pathways, such as homeoboxes, nuclear receptors, the Wnt signaling pathway, and sodium channels, have provided evidence in support of the latter two scenarios. These findings indicate that ctenophores may either be sister to Cnidaria, Placozoa, and Bilateria, or to all other animal phyla. Additionally, recent studies comparing the complete genomes of ctenophores with other animals have further supported the idea that ctenophores are the sister lineage to all other animals. This hypothesis implies that neural and muscle cell types were either lost in major animal lineages like Porifera, or that they evolved independently in the ctenophore lineage. However, some researchers argue that the placement of Ctenophora as sister to all other animals is simply a statistical anomaly arising from the rapid evolution observed in ctenophore genomes.

This means that they do not exclusively descend from a single common ancestor that was itself a cydippid. Instead, Harbison found that different cydippid families were more similar to members of other ctenophore groups than to other cydippids.

It confirmed that cydippids are not monophyletic and indicated that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores likely had a body similar to that of a cydippid. The analysis also revealed that the genetic differences between these species were minute, making it difficult to determine the exact relationships between the Lobata, Cestida, and Thalassocalycida groups within ctenophores. This suggests that the last common ancestor of modern ctenophores existed relatively recently and may have survived the Cretaceous\u2013Paleogene extinction event that occurred approximately 65.5 million years ago, while other ctenophore lineages perished. \n\nWhen representatives of other phyla were included in the analysis, it also indicated that cnidarians (such as jellyfish) are likely more closely related to bilaterians (organisms with bilateral symmetry) than either group is to ctenophores.

Over time, the city acquired additional acres, making the park a substantial 300 acres (1.2 km2) in total. Woodward Park holds the distinction of being the only regional park of this scale in the Central Valley, offering a wealth of amenities and natural beauty.\n\nThe southeast corner of the park is a haven for bird enthusiasts, with an impressive array of bird species to observe. The park boasts a versatile amphitheater capable of accommodating up to 2,500 people, a breathtaking Japanese Garden, a dedicated dog park, and even a two-mile (3 km) equestrian trail. Additionally, visitors can enjoy an exercise par course, three children's playgrounds, a picturesque lake, three small ponds, and a network of five miles (8 km) of multipurpose trails. These trails are part of the San Joaquin River Parkway's Lewis S. Eaton Trail, a larger trail system that will eventually span 22 miles (35 km) from Highway 99 to Friant Dam.\n\nFor those seeking a tranquil retreat from city life, Woodward Park offers numerous picnic areas complete with picnic tables scattered throughout the park. The park's amphitheater, which underwent renovations in 2010, has attracted renowned acts such as Deftones, Tech N9ne, and Sevendust, along with many others.

Another perspective put forth by Scott and Duncan is that the pandemic resembled a highly contagious infectious disease, exhibiting symptoms consistent with hemorrhagic plague similar to Ebola.

The land originally housed Brompton Park House, which was expanded with the addition of the \"Brompton Boilers\" \u2013 utilitarian iron galleries that had a temporary appearance and were eventually repurposed to construct the V&A Museum of Childhood. The first permanent structure to be built within the museum complex was the Sheepshanks Gallery in 1857, situated on the eastern side of the garden. Captain Francis Fowke, a civil engineer from the Royal Engineers, was the architect responsible for this gallery, having been appointed by Cole. Subsequent expansions, such as the Turner and Vernon galleries erected in 1858-9 to house specific collections (later transferred to the Tate Gallery), were also designed by Fowke. These galleries now serve as the picture and tapestry galleries respectively. The North and South Courts were constructed shortly after and were both open to the public by June 1862. Currently, these areas house temporary exhibitions and are located directly behind the Sheepshanks Gallery. The Secretariat Wing can be found at the northernmost part of the site and was also built in 1862.

Additionally, Lord Leighton commenced the creation of a series of frescoes titled \"Industrial Arts as Applied to War 1878-1880\" and \"Industrial Arts Applied to Peace,\" although the latter remained unfinished. Adjacent to these galleries, the Oriental Courts were constructed, showcasing fascinating decorations inspired by India, China, and Japan. Unfortunately, none of these splendid adornments have survived, but several of the galleries were later transformed to exhibit the wonders of the 19th century, which were unveiled in December 2006. Amongst the final contributions of Fowke was the design for the buildings encircling the garden's north and west sides. Notably, the Museum Caf\u00e9, restored in 2006, occupies the ground floor, while the silver gallery, which formerly housed ceramics, is situated above. A remarkable lecture theatre also graces the top floor, though it is rarely accessible to the general public. The ceramic staircase positioned in the northwest corner of this building range was conceptualized by F. W. Moody and showcases intricate architectural details crafted from molded and colored pottery. The entirety of the north range was constructed between the years 1864 and 1869, with an emphasis on the magnificent style of the Italian Renaissance. Terracotta, brick, and mosaic were extensively employed, infusing grandeur into the north fa\u00e7ade which was intended to serve as the primary entrance to the museum. Immaculately designed bronze doors, skillfully crafted by James Gamble & Reuben Townroe, feature six panels depicting a diverse range of prominent figures, including Humphry Davy (chemistry), Isaac Newton (astronomy), James Watt (mechanics), Bramante (architecture), Michelangelo (sculpture), and Titian (painting). These panels serve as a true representation of the museum's rich collections. Godfrey Sykes, in conjunction with Percival Ball, contributed to the overall splendor by adding terracotta embellishments and a mosaic in the pediment of the North Fa\u00e7ade, commemorating the Great Exhibition.

Additionally, a noteworthy feature was the wrought iron gates, designed by Starkie Gardner as late as 1885, which provided access to a passage within the building. Another remarkable addition to the museum, known as the Cast Courts, was designed by Scott himself between 1870 and 1873. These expansive spaces, situated southeast of the garden on the site of the \"Brompton Boilers,\" boast ceilings reaching a staggering height of 70 feet (21 m). Their purpose was to house plaster casts of renowned architectural elements, including the iconic Trajan's Column, which was divided into two separate pieces. Complementing this, Scott's architectural vision extended further to include the construction of the Art Library and what now serves as the sculpture gallery on the south side of the garden. This particular section, built from 1877 to 1883, featured mosaic panels on its exterior parapet, thoughtfully designed by Reuben Townroe. Townroe also lent his artistic expertise to the plaster work within the library. Notably, Sir John Taylor was responsible for the design of the bookshelves and cases, and this area was the first part of the museum to be illuminated by electric lighting.

This allowed us to enhance accessibility for researchers by making the new photographs available on the museum's website.\n\nDuring the inaugural year of the Factory Project, we successfully captured a staggering 15,000 images, encompassing a diverse range of art forms such as drawings, watercolors, computer-generated art, photographs, posters, and woodcuts. Building upon this progress, the next step is to diligently catalog each item, ensuring a comprehensive database that facilitates efficient retrieval of information.\n\nTo maintain an accurate record, the Factory Project also incorporates an essential auditing phase. We meticulously cross-reference the items we have photographed and cataloged with their physical existence within the collection. This crucial step ensures that all listed items were physically accounted for during the project's implementation.\n\nFurthermore, our commitment to conservation is a paramount goal of the Factory Project. We perform necessary preventive procedures to safeguard the integrity of the collection, ensuring its longevity for future generations to appreciate and study.\n\nUsers of the Victoria and Albert Museum website benefit greatly from our large-scale digitization endeavors. The inclusion of a user-friendly \"Search the Collections\" feature allows visitors to explore numerous items within our comprehensive computer databases.\n\nUltimately, the Factory Project evolved as a response to the widespread need to expand and document the collections through digitization. By harnessing cutting-edge technology and drawing inspiration from Andy Warhol's innovative legacy, we strive to capture, preserve, and share the rich artistic heritage housed within the Victoria and Albert Museum.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 157, "text": "2007"}, {"answer_start": 157, "text": "2007"}, {"answer_start": 157, "text": "2007"}], "question": "In which year did the V&A's Word and Image Department began a large scale digitization project?", "id": "5726cfa3708984140094d209"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 177, "text": "Factory Project"}, {"answer_start": 177, "text": "Factory Project"}, {"answer_start": 578, "text": "the Factory Project"}], "question": "What was the digitization project called?", "id": "5726cfa3708984140094d20a"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 222, "text": "Andy Warhol"}, {"answer_start": 222, "text": "Andy Warhol"}, {"answer_start": 222, "text": "Andy Warhol"}], "question": "The title of the digitization project was a reference to which artist?", "id": "5726cfa3708984140094d20b"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 637, "text": "15,000"}, {"answer_start": 637, "text": "15,000"}, {"answer_start": 637, "text": "15,000"}], "question": "Approximately how many images were digitized during the first year of the digitization project?", "id": "5726cfa3708984140094d20c"}]}, {"context": "Within the exhibition, visitors can admire an extensive collection of artwork and craftsmanship from both British artists and their European counterparts, which has been acquired or commissioned by British patrons.

In the Georgian age, there was a growing focus on entertainment and leisure, as evidenced by the rising popularity of tea drinking and the subsequent production of tea-related items like china and caddies.

Additionally, Disney acquired the magazine and newspaper properties that were previously owned by Capital Cities/ABC.

Resultantly, the independent station KCAL-TV was sold to Young Broadcasting for a total of $387 million.\n\nOn April 4,  Disney went on to sell the four newspapers that ABC had controlled under Capital Cities to Knight Ridder for a significant sum of $1.65 billion. This transaction aimed to comply with regulatory requirements and maintain a healthy media landscape.\n\nFollowing the successful merger, Thomas S.

Occasionally, in markets where a third full-time affiliate was feasible, the only available commercial allocation was on the less-desirable UHF band. It was worth noting that the All-Channel Receiver Act, which required UHF tuning, was not passed by Congress until 1961. This meant that viewers had to purchase a converter to access UHF stations before this mandate. Even with a converter, the signal quality was often marginal at best.

Unfortunately, Inalchuq, the governor of Otrar, a city in Khwarezmia, launched an unprovoked attack on the caravan, falsely accusing them of espionage against Khwarezmia. This worrisome situation grew even more complex when Inalchuq refused to compensate for the looting and failed to hand over the culprits responsible for the attack.\n\nDetermined to resolve the matter directly, Genghis Khan sent a second group of ambassadors, consisting of two Mongols and a Muslim, to meet Shah Ala ad-Din Muhammad himself, bypassing the governor.

Moreover, he introduced the traditional Mongolian script, preserving the cultural heritage of the nation, and created the Ikh Zasag (Great Administration), which became Mongolia's first written law. The Ikh Zasag law, enacted during Genghis Khan's reign, placed great emphasis on severe penalties for offenses related to corruption and bribery. This historical fact was emphasized by Mongolian President Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj, who considers Genghis Khan a role model for anti-corruption efforts. Elbegdorj admires Genghis Khan's commitment to equal protection under the law for all citizens, regardless of their social status or wealth. In his speech commemorating the 850th anniversary of Chinggis Khaan's birth, Elbegdorj highlights Genghis Khan's profound understanding that justice stems from the equality of the law rather than distinctions between individuals.

Thucydides documented how individuals who had previously survived the disease were able to care for the sick without becoming infected again.\n\nMoving forward in history, in the 18th century, Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis conducted experiments with scorpion venom and discovered that some animals, like dogs and mice, were immune to its effects. These early observations of acquired immunity laid the foundation for further research by renowned scientists like Louis Pasteur.\n\nPasteur's groundbreaking work included the development of vaccination and the proposal of the germ theory of disease, which contradicted prevailing theories at the time, such as the miasma theory. It wasn't until Robert Koch's experiments in 1891 that microorganisms were definitively identified as the cause of infectious diseases. Koch's findings were so significant that he was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1905.\n\nIn the early 1900s, the yellow fever virus was confirmed as a human pathogen following Walter Reed's discovery in 1901.

This poses a challenge for peptide and protein-based drugs, which are typically larger than 6000 Da. Sometimes, the drug itself may not be immunogenic, but when combined with an immunogenic compound like Taxol, it can lead to immune reactions. To tackle this issue, we have developed computational methods in the field of immunoinformatics to predict the immunogenicity of peptides and proteins. These methods are particularly helpful in designing therapeutic antibodies, assessing the potential virulence of mutations in viral coat particles, and validating peptide-based drug treatments. Initially, the prediction techniques relied on the observation that hydrophilic amino acids are more prevalent in epitope regions compared to hydrophobic amino acids. However, recent advancements in machine learning now allow us to use databases of known epitopes, especially those present in well-studied virus proteins, to train our models. To facilitate research in this area, we have established a publicly accessible database that catalogs epitopes recognized by B cells from various pathogens.

Specifically, during the initial stage of deep sleep, there is a sudden decrease in stress hormones like cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine, leading to an increase in the levels of important hormones such as leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin. These hormonal changes trigger an inflammatory response by stimulating the production of cytokines like interleukin-1, interleukin-12, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma. As a result, the immune system becomes activated, leading to the proliferation and differentiation of immune cells, particularly undifferentiated or less differentiated T cells like na\u00efve and central memory T cells. This occurs at a time when the adaptive immune response is slowly developing. Furthermore, the hormones released during this period, specifically leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin, facilitate the interaction between antigen-presenting cells (APCs) and T cells. They also contribute to a shift in the balance of cytokines produced by T helper cells towards a Th1 response, an overall increase in Th cell proliferation, and the migration of na\u00efve T cells to lymph nodes.

In this poem, Shelley vividly portrays the oppressive forms of authority prevalent at that time, while also envisioning a new approach to social action.\n\nShelley's poem can be considered an early expression of the principle of nonviolent protest, which gained further prominence through the works of renowned figures such as Henry David Thoreau and Mahatma Gandhi. Thoreau famously incorporated these ideas into his essay \"Civil Disobedience,\" which resonated with many activists of the time. Meanwhile, Gandhi found inspiration in Shelley's nonviolent approach to protest and political action, integrating it into his doctrine of Satyagraha.\n\nGandhi, during the campaign for a free India, frequently quoted Shelley's \"The Mask of Anarchy\" to large audiences.

Thoreau believes that each individual possesses the ultimate authority to determine what is morally right and wrong. Furthermore, since only individuals take action, it is only individuals who can commit acts of injustice. When the government comes knocking, it is an individual in the role of a mail carrier or tax collector who physically impacts the wooden door. Prior to Thoreau's imprisonment, when a perplexed tax collector expressed uncertainty about how to address Thoreau's refusal to pay, Thoreau advised him to \"Resign.\" In this way, Thoreau intended to compel the individual to recognize and acknowledge their active choice to become an instrument of injustice. However, if the government is commonly perceived as \"the voice of the people,\" shouldn't their voice be respected? Thoreau acknowledges that the government may reflect the desires of the majority, but it can also echo the interests of powerful politicians. Even a well-designed system of government is susceptible to manipulation and distortion before the people are able to exercise their influence through it.

However, it is widely acknowledged that rebellion, in comparison, tends to be much more destructive. Consequently, the defects which justify rebellion must be significantly more serious than those supporting disobedience. It follows that if one cannot find justification for civil rebellion, then the use of force, violence, and refusal to submit to arrest by civil disobedients cannot be justified either.\n\nMoreover, one should also consider the role of non-violence in preserving society's tolerance for civil disobedience. By refraining from violence, civil disobedients contribute to an environment that upholds this tolerance. The importance of this cannot be understated, as it ensures that civil disobedience remains an acceptable form of protest within our society.\n\nAs a legal scholar, I believe it is crucial to carefully examine the nuances of civil disobedience and its potential overlap with violence.

Furthermore, the combined net worth of individuals referred to as the \"10 million dollar millionaires\" surged to nearly $41 trillion in 2008. Oxfam, a renowned organization, reported in January 2014 that the 85 wealthiest individuals possessed wealth equivalent to that of more than half (about 3.5 billion people) of the world's population. This finding was confirmed by a Los Angeles Times analysis of the report, which concluded that the wealthiest 1% owned 46% of the world's wealth, with the 85 richest individuals holding 0.7% of human population's wealth, the same as the wealth held by the bottom half of the population. Recent projections by Oxfam indicate that the top 1% will own more than half of the global wealth by 2016.

Our team had been meticulously planning and discussing the show for a year, led by the talented Canadian Sydney Newman, along with Donald Wilson and C. E. Webber. Together, we aimed to create a program that would cater to a wide family audience, combining elements of education, time travel, and exploration of historical events.\n\nHowever, when it came to selecting the next script, we faced some obstacles. The original idea was titled \"The Mutants\" and was written by Terry Nation. Initially, it centered around a neutron bomb attack on the Daleks and Thals, who were victims of the aggression. However, we were instructed that the program should not include any \"bug-eyed monsters,\" so the script was rejected upon its presentation to Newman and Wilson. Despite this setback, we were in a tight spot as we only had the Dalek serial available to proceed with. This led to a momentary crisis of confidence, especially since Donald Wilson strongly opposed using it. Nevertheless, considering the lack of alternatives, we proceeded with Nation's script, ultimately resulting in the second Doctor Who serial, titled \"The Daleks\" (also known as \"The Mutants\").\n\nAlthough it wasn't our initial plan, this decision turned out to be a turning point for the show.

For instance, there was the thrilling 12-episode saga known as The Daleks' Master Plan, which even had an additional one-episode teaser called \"Mission to the Unknown\" without any of the regular cast. Another memorable season broke the mold with seven-episode serials, captivating fans with unique narratives. Then there was the gripping 10-episode serial titled The War Games, which kept viewers on the edge of their seats. And who could forget The Trial of a Time Lord, a captivating storyline that unfolded over 14 episodes during season 23, cleverly divided into three production codes and four narrative segments?\n\nI've always appreciated how Doctor Who would occasionally tie its serials together with a connecting storyline. For example, season 8 delved into the Doctor's epic battle against a renegade Time Lord known as The Master, creating intense and unforgettable moments. In season 16, fans were taken on an enthralling quest known as The Key to Time, bringing a sense of mystery and adventure. Season 18 took us on a remarkable journey through E-Space, exploring the theme of entropy and leaving fans in awe. And of course, season 20 treated us to the mesmerizing Black Guardian Trilogy, a trio of episodes that left us craving for more.

One notable area of impact is in the field of economics, where the university played a pivotal role in shaping ideas about the free market. This contribution is so significant that it led to the development of the renowned Chicago school of economics, which was strongly supported by influential economists like Milton Friedman. Similarly, in the realm of sociology, the university's sociology department holds a prominent position as the first independent department of its kind in the United States, giving birth to the renowned Chicago school of sociology.\n\nThe university's rich scientific legacy also extends to the field of physics. It was at the University of Chicago where the groundbreaking Chicago Pile-1 project took place, marking the first successful achievement of a self-sustained man-made nuclear reaction, and a crucial part of the prominent Manhattan Project. Additionally, renowned physicist Robert Millikan conducted his famous oil-drop experiment at the university, which revolutionized our understanding of the charge of the electron. Moreover, the university made significant contributions to the development of radiocarbon dating through the work of Willard F. Libby in 1947.\n\nWhen it comes to the origins of life, the University of Chicago also played a pivotal role. It was here that the Miller-Urey experiment, a chemical experiment aiming to understand how life potentially originated on early Earth, was conducted. This experiment remains a landmark in the field and has had a lasting impact on our understanding of the origins of life.\n\nThe University of Chicago's contributions to scientific research expand beyond the physical sciences as well. In 1953, two researchers named Nathaniel Kleitman and Eugene Aserinsky made a significant discovery at the university. They identified and named REM (Rapid Eye Movement) sleep, a distinct phase of sleep that is characterized by rapid eye movements and heightened brain activity. This remarkable finding has since become foundational to the field of sleep research.\n\nOverall, the University of Chicago's vast array of experiments and academic movements have left an indelible mark on numerous fields of study, bringing forth crucial breakthroughs and shaping our understanding of the world around us.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 236, "text": "shaping ideas about the free market"}, {"answer_start": 236, "text": "shaping ideas about the free market"}, {"answer_start": 236, "text": "shaping ideas about the free market"}], "question": "What role in economics did the university play a major part in?", "id": "57286010ff5b5019007da1ca"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 833, "text": "Chicago Pile-1"}, {"answer_start": 833, "text": "Chicago Pile-1"}], "question": "What was the name of the first self-sustained man-made nuclear reaction?", "id": "57286010ff5b5019007da1cb"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 1813, "text": "1953"}, {"answer_start": 1813, "text": "1953"}, {"answer_start": 1813, "text": "1953"}], "question": "When was REM sleep discovered?", "id": "57286010ff5b5019007da1cd"}]}, {"context": "The University of Chicago Arts program is integrated with different academic departments and programs within the College and the Division of the Humanities, as well as professional organizations such as the Oriental Institute, Court Theatre, Smart Museum of Art, Renaissance Society, University of Chicago Presents, and student arts organizations.

Some members of the Tran clan still retained their Chinese language proficiency, as evidenced by the meeting between a Yuan dynasty envoy and the Chinese-speaking Tr\u1ea7n prince, Tr\u1ea7n Qu\u1ed1c Tu\u1ea5n (later known as King Tr\u1ea7n H\u01b0ng \u0110\u1ea1o), in 1282. Notably, Song dynasty Chinese individuals such as Zhao Zhong and Xu Zongdao sought refuge in Tran dynasty-ruled Vietnam after the Mongol invasion of the Song. They played pivotal roles in aiding the Tran dynasty in their fight against the Mongol invasion. It is interesting to note that the Tran dynasty had its roots in the Fujian region of China, just like the Daoist cleric Xu Zongdao, who documented the Mongol invasion, referring to them as \"Northern bandits\".

However, we realized that the lack of affordability was hindering access to education beyond primary level.\n\nTo tackle this, in January 2003, the Government of Kenya took a significant step by implementing free primary education, resulting in a noteworthy increase of approximately 70% in primary school enrolment. However, we observed that secondary and tertiary education enrolment did not witness a proportional growth due to the financial constraints faced by students and their families.\n\nTo address this issue, in 2008, our government made a crucial announcement stating that secondary education would be heavily subsidized. By shouldering all tuition fees, we aimed to make secondary education more accessible. This move was intended to further facilitate school drop-outs at all levels to either become self-employed or secure employment, not only in the informal sector but also in more formal job sectors.\n\nOur main objective with these initiatives is to provide equal opportunities to all students, ensuring that they have access to quality education regardless of their economic backgrounds.

The primary characteristic that sets empires apart is their extensive territorial conquest and expansion. While political power primarily originated from land conquests, the influence of sea and trade routes significantly fostered cultural and economic development. Notably, empires were distinguished by the fact that the spread of economic and cultural influence occurred predominantly through seaborne means, despite political expansion taking place mostly on land. Trade across the seas particularly involved the exchange of various animal and plant products. In the study of imperialism, European empires in Asia and Africa are often considered the prototypical examples, as most scholarly works in this field primarily focus on these seaborne empires. The European expansion also gave rise to the division of the world into developed and developing nations, as depicted by the world systems theory. This theory identifies two main regions: the core, characterized by prosperity and high income, and the periphery, symbolizing lower income and profit. These critical Geo-political theories have sparked discussions on the implications and significance of imperialism in the contemporary post-colonial world. Highlighting the evolution of imperialism, the Russian leader Lenin argued that imperialism represented the pinnacle of capitalism, distinct from colonialism due to the prevalence of monopoly capitalism. Lenin's concept emphasizes the increasing importance of a new global political order in our modern era.

The term \"Imperialism\" was first introduced in English during the late 1870s by critics who opposed the perceived aggressive and showy imperial policies of British Prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. Soon after, supporters of \"imperialism,\" such as Joseph Chamberlain, embraced the term. For some, imperialism represented a philosophy rooted in idealism and philanthropy, while others argued it was driven by political self-interest. An increasing number of people linked imperialism with capitalist greed. Liberal thinker John A. Hobson and Marxist theorist Vladimir Lenin provided additional theoretical and macroeconomic dimensions to the term. Lenin's work, \"Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism,\" in particular, exerted significant influence over subsequent Marxist interpretations of imperialism. In his writings, Lenin depicted imperialism as a natural progression of capitalism, stemming from the incessant need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources, and manpower, which ultimately necessitated colonial expansion. This understanding of imperialism as an inherent feature of capitalism resonates with later Marxist scholars. Many left-leaning theorists subsequently emphasized the structural and systemic nature of \"imperialism.\" They broadened the chronological scope of imperialism, extending it to encompass not just a policy or a few decades in the late 19th century, but a world system spanning centuries, often traced back to Christopher Columbus and, in some accounts, even the Crusades.

Some, like Trotsky, believed that it could only triumph as part of a larger world revolution. Lenin, known for his extensive writings on the topic, famously argued that capitalism had reached its highest stage with imperialism. However, after Lenin's passing, Joseph Stalin implemented a policy known as 'socialism in one country' for the Soviet Union. This approach prioritized internal development and gave rise to inward-looking Stalinist states, leading to the purge of the initial internationalist elements. The focus on internationalist tendencies diminished until they resurfaced during the Cold War, when the Soviet Union adopted a client state strategy in competition with the United States. This new era, often referred to as the \"thaw\" following Stalin's rule, began in the late 1950s and saw Nikita Khrushchev, the new political leader, intensify pressure on Soviet-American relations through increased anti-imperialist propaganda. In his 1960 speech at the UN conference, Khrushchev announced the continuation of the struggle against imperialism and predicted that people in various countries would unite and overthrow their imperialist leaders. While the Soviet Union declared itself anti-imperialist, critics argue that it displayed traits commonly associated with historic empires. Some scholars believe that the USSR was a hybrid entity, embodying characteristics of both multinational empires and nation-states. Others assert that the USSR engaged in colonial practices similar to other imperial powers, continuing the tradition of expansion and control inherited from Russian history.

However, when this actual experiment was conducted, the cannonball consistently fell at the foot of the mast, seemingly moving in sync with the ship despite being detached from it.

According to this theory, gravity is not considered as a force, but rather, objects in gravitational fields move freely along straight lines through curved space-time - known as the shortest path between two events in space and time. From the perspective of the object, there is no apparent gravitational influence on its motion. It is only when observing the object's motion from a global viewpoint that we can detect the curvature of space-time and infer the presence of gravitational force from the object's curved path. In this way, what appears as a straight line path in space-time is perceived as a curved trajectory in space, commonly referred to as the object's ballistic trajectory.

Other lesser-known units of force include the sth\u00e8ne, which is equivalent to 1000 newtons, and the kip, which is equivalent to 1000 pound-force.", "qas": [{"answers": [{"answer_start": 40, "text": "kilopond"}, {"answer_start": 40, "text": "kilopond"}, {"answer_start": 40, "text": "kilopond"}, {"answer_start": 40, "text": "kilopond"}, {"answer_start": 40, "text": "kilopond"}], "question": "What is the kilogram-force sometimes reffered to as?", "id": "5737aafd1c456719005744fc"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 281, "text": "slug"}, {"answer_start": 274, "text": "metric slug"}, {"answer_start": 274, "text": "metric slug"}, {"answer_start": 274, "text": "metric slug"}, {"answer_start": 270, "text": "the metric slug"}], "question": "What is a very seldom used unit of mass in the metric system?", "id": "5737aafd1c456719005744fd"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 824, "text": "kip"}, {"answer_start": 824, "text": "kip"}, {"answer_start": 824, "text": "kip"}, {"answer_start": 824, "text": "kip"}, {"answer_start": 824, "text": "kip"}], "question": "What seldom used term of a unit of force equal to 1000 pound s of force?", "id": "5737aafd1c456719005744fe"}, {"answers": [{"answer_start": 771, "text": "sth\u00e8ne"}, {"answer_start": 771, "text": "sth\u00e8ne"}, {"answer_start": 771, "text": "sth\u00e8ne"}, {"answer_start": 771, "text": "sth\u00e8ne"}, {"answer_start": 771, "text": "sth\u00e8ne"}], "question": "What is the seldom used force unit equal to one thousand newtons?", "id": "5737aafd1c456719005744ff"}]}]}], "version": "1.1"}
